  <title>EPICS Base R3.15.0.1 Release Notes</title>
</head>

<body lang="en">
<h1 align="center">EPICS Base Release 3.15.0.1</h1>

<p>
EPICS Base 3.15.0.x releases are not intended for use in production systems.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.15.0.1 and 3.15.0.2</h2>
<!-- Insert new items immediately below here ... -->

<h3>errlogRemoveListener() routine changed</h3>

<p>Code that calls <tt>errlogRemoveListener(myfunc)</tt> must be modified to use
the new, safer routine <tt>errlogRemoveListeners(myfunc, &amp;pvt)</tt> instead.
The replacement routine takes a second argument which must be the same private
pointer that was passed to <tt>errlogAddListener()</tt> when adding that
listener. It also deletes all matching listeners (hence the new plural name) and
returns how many were actually deleted, whereas the previous routine only
removed the first listener that matched.</p>

<h3>Simplified generation of .dbd files</h3>

<p>The Perl script <tt>makeIncludeDbd.pl</tt> has been removed and the rules
that created an intermediate <tt><i>xxx</i>Include.dbd</tt> file from the
Makefile variable <tt>xxx_DBD</tt> have been modified to generate the target
<tt><i>xxx</i>.dbd</tt> file directly. This should simplify applications that
might have had to provide dependency rules for the intermediate files in 3.15.
Applications which provide their own <tt><i>xxx</i>Include.dbd</tt> source file
will continue to have it expanded as before.</p>

<h3>New Undefined Severity field UDFS</h3>

<p>A new field has been added to dbCommon which configures the alarm severity
associated with the record being undefined (when UDF=TRUE). The default value is
INVALID so old databases will not be affected, but now individual records can be
configured to have a lower severity or even no alarm when undefined. Be careful
when changing this on applications where the IVOA field of output records is
used, IVOA still requires an INVALID severity to trigger value replacement.</p>

<h3>New build target <q>tapfiles</q></h3>

<p>This new make target runs the same tests as the <q>runtests</q> target, but
instead of summarizing or displaying the output for each test script it creates
a <q>.tap</q> file inside the architecture build directory which contains the
detailed test output. The output file can be parsed by continuous integration
packages such as <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> to show the
test results.</p>

<h3>Array field double-buffering</h3>

<p>Array data can now be moved, without copying, into and out of the VAL field
of the waveform, aai, and aao record types by replacing the pointer in BPTR.
The basic rules which device support must follow are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>BPTR, and the memory it is currently pointing to, can only be accessed
      while the record is locked.</li>
    <li>NELM may not be changed; NORD should be updated whenever the number of
      valid data elements changes.</li>
    <li>When BPTR is replaced it must always point to a block of memory large
      enough to hold the maximum number of elements, as given by the NELM and
      FTVL fields.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Spin-locks API added</h3>

<p>The new header file epicsSpin.h adds a portable spin-locks API which is
intended for locking very short sections of code (typically one or two lines of
C or C++) to provide a critical section that protects against race conditions.
On Posix platforms this uses the pthread_spinlock_t type if it's available but
falls back to a pthread_mutex_t if not; on the UP VxWorks and RTEMS platforms
the implementations lock out the CPU interrupts; the default implementation
(used where no better implementation is available for the platform) uses an
epicsMutex. Spin-locks may not be taken recursively, and the code inside the
critical section should always be short and deterministic.</p>

<h3>Improvements to aToIPAddr()</h3>

<p>The libCom routine aToIPAddr() and the vxWorks implementation of the
associated hostToIPAddr() function have been modified to be able to look up
hostnames that begin with one or more digits. The epicsSockResolveTest program
was added to check this functionality.</p>

<h3>mbboDirect and mbbiDirect records</h3>

<p>These record types have undergone some significant rework, and will behave
slightly differently than they did in their 3.14 versions. The externally
visible changes are as follows:</p>

<h5>mbbiDirect</h5>

<ul>
  <li>If the MASK field is set in a database file, it will not be over-written
    when the record is initialized. This allows non-contiguous masks to be set,
    although only the device support actually uses the MASK field.</li>
  <li>If process() finds the UDF field to be set, the record will raise a
    UDF/INVALID alarm.</li>
</ul>

<h5>mbboDirect</h5>

<ul>
  <li>If the MASK field is set in a database file, it will not be over-written
    when the record is initialized. This allows non-contiguous masks to be set,
    although only the device support actually uses the MASK field.</li>
  <li>After the device support's init_record() routine returns during record
    initialization, if OMSL is <q>supervisory</q> and UDF is clear the fields
    B0-BF will be set from the current VAL field.</li>
  <li>When a put to the OMSL field sets it to <q>supervisory</q>, the fields
    B0-BF will be set from the current VAL field. This did not used to happen,
    the individual bit fields were previously never modified by the record.
    Note that this change may require some databases to be modified, if they
    were designed to take advantage of the previous behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Redirection of the errlog console stream</h3>

<p>A new routine has been added to the errlog facility which allows the console
error message stream to be redirected from stderr to some other already open
file stream:</p>

<blockquote><pre>int errlogSetConsole(FILE *stream);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The stream argument must be a FILE* pointer as returned by fopen() that is
open for output. If NULL is passed in, the errlog thread's stderr output stream
will be used instead. Note that messages to the console can be disabled and
re-enabled using the eltc routine which is also an iocsh command, but there is
no iocsh command currently provided for calling errlogSetConsole.</p>

<h3>Add cleanup subroutine to aSub record</h3>

<p>An aSub routine may set the CADR field with a function pointer which will be
run before a new routine in the event that a change to the SNAM field changes
the record's process subroutine.</p>

<p>This can be used to free any resources the routine needs to allocate. It can
also be used to determine if this is the first time this routine has been called
by this record instance. The CADR field is set to NULL immediately after the
routine it points to is called.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>void cleanup(aSubRecord* prec) {
    free(prec-&gt;dpvt);
    prec-&gt;dpvt = NULL;
}

long myAsubRoutine(aSubRecord* prec) {
    if (!prec-&gt;cadr) {
        /* check types of inputs and outputs */
        if (prec-&gt;ftva != menuFtypeDOUBLE)
            return 1; /* oops */

        dpvt = malloc(42);
        prec-&gt;cadr = &amp;cleanup;
    }

    /* normal processing */
}
epicsRegisterFunction(myAsubRoutine);
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Sequence record enhancements</h3>

<p>The sequence record type now has 16 link groups numbered 0 through 9 and A
through F, instead of the previous 10 groups numbered 1 through 9 and A. The
changes to this record are directly equivalent to those described below for the
fanout record. The fields OFFS and SHFT have been added and operate on the SELN
value exactly the same way. The result is backwards compatible with the 3.14
version of the sequence record as long as none of the new fields are modified
and the application does not rely on the SOFT/INVALID alarm that was generated
when the selection number exceeded 10. The record also now posts monitors on the
SELN field at the end of the sequence if its value changed when read through the
SELL link.

<h3>Fanout record enhancements</h3>

<p>The fanout record type now has 16 output links LNK0-LNK9 and LNKA-LNKF, plus
two additional fields which make the result backwards compatible with 3.14
databases, but also allow the link selection to be shifted without having to
process the SELN value through a calc or calcout record first.</p>

<p>Previously there was no LNK0 field, so when SELM is <q>Mask</q> bit 0 of SELN
controls whether the LNK1 link field was activated; bit 1 controls LNK2 and so
on. When SELM is <q>Specified</q> and SELN is zero no output link would be
activated at all; LNK1 gets activated when SELN is 1 and so on. Only 6 links
were provided, LNK1 through LNK6. The updated record type maintains the original
behavior when the new fields are not configured, except that the SOFT/INVALID
alarm is not generated when SELN is 7 through 15.</p>

<p>The update involved adding a LNK0 field, as well as fields LNK7 through LNK9
and LNKA through LNKF. To add flexibility and maintain backwards compatibility,
two additional fields have been added:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>OFFS</b></dt>

<dd>This field holds a signed offset which is added to SELN to select which link
to activate when SELM is <q>Specified</q>. If the resulting value is outside the
range 0 .. 15 the record will go into a SOFT/INVALID alarm state. The default
value of OFFS is zero, so if it is not explicitly set and SELN is 1 the LNK1
link will be activated.</dd>

<dt><b>SHFT</b></dt>

<dd>When SELM is <q>Mask</q> the signed field SHFT is used to shift the SELN
value by SHFT bits (positive means right-wards, values outside the range -15 ..
15 will result in a SOFT/INVALID alarm), before using the resulting bit-pattern
to control which links to activate. The default value is -1, so if SHFT is not
explicitly set bit 0 of SELN will be used to control whether LNK1 gets
activated.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The record also now posts monitors on the SELN field if it changes as a
result of record processing (i.e. when read through the SELL link).</p>

<h3>Deleted Java build rules</h3>

<p>Java has its own build systems now, so we've deleted the rules and associated
variables from Base, although they might get added to the Extensions build rules
for a while in case anyone still needs them.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.14.x and 3.15.0.1</h2>

<h3>Application clean rules</h3>

<p>The <tt>clean</tt> Makefile target has changed between a single-colon rule
and a double-colon rule more than once in the life of the EPICS build rules, and
it just changed back to a single-colon rule, but now we recommend that
applications that wish to provide a Makefile that is backwards compatible with
the 3.14 build rules use the construct shown below.  The 3.15 rules now support
a variable called <tt>CLEANS</tt> to which a Makefile can add a list of files to
be deleted when the user does a <tt>make clean</tt> like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>CLEANS += &lt;list of files to be cleaned&gt;

ifndef BASE_3_15
clean::
	$(RM) $(CLEANS)
endif</pre></blockquote>

<p>The conditional rule provides compatibility for use with the 3.14 build
system.</p>

<h3>MSI included with Base</h3>

<p>An enhanced version of the Macro Substitution and Include program <q>msi</q>
has been included with Base. Both this new version of msi and the IOC's
<tt>dbLoadTemplates</tt> command now support setting global macros in
substitution files, and <tt>dbLoadTemplates</tt> can now take a list of global
macro settings as the second argument on its command line. The substitution file
syntax is documented in the Application Developers Guide.</p>

<h3>Cross-builds targeting win32-x86-mingw</h3>

<p>Some Linux distributions now package the MinGW cross-compiler which makes it
possible to cross-build the win32-x86-mingw target from a linux-x86 host. Build
configuration files for this combination are now included; adjust the settings
in configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86.win32-x86-mingw and add win32-x86-mingw to
the CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS variable in configure/CONFIG_SITE or in
configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86.Common.</p>

<h3>Architecture win32-x86-cygwin Removed</h3>

<p>The ability to compile non-cygwin binaries using the Cygwin build tools is no
longer supported by current versions of Cygwin, so this architecture has been
removed. Use the MinWG tools and the win32-x86-mingw architecture instead.</p>

<h3>RTEMS and VxWorks Test Harnesses</h3>

<p>The original libCom test harness has been renamed <tt>libComTestHarness</tt>,
and two additional test harnesses have been created <tt>dbTestHarness</tt> and
<tt>filterTestHarness</tt> which are all built for RTEMS and vxWorks targets.
The new ones include tests in src/ioc/db/test and src/std/filters/test.</p>

<p>Running the new tests requires additional .db and .dbd files to be loaded at
runtime, which can be found in the relevant source directory or its O.Common
subdirectory. If the target can access the Base source tree directly it may be
simplest to cd to the relevant source directory before running the test. If not,
the files needed are listed in the generated 'testspec' file found in the
associated build (O.<i>arch</i>) directory.</p>

<p>For RTEMS users the current directory is determined in a BSP specific way.
See rtems_init.c and setBootConfigFromNVRAM.c in src/libCom/RTEMS.</p>

<h3>New API to hook into thread creation</h3>

<p>A hook API has been added allowing user-supplied functions to be called
whenever a thread starts. The calls are made from the thread's context,
and can be used to control additional thread properties not handled inside
EPICS base, e.g. setting the scheduling policy or CPU affinity (on SMP
systems).</p>

<p>The API also supports a mapping operation, calling a user-supplied function
for every thread that is currently running.</p>

<h3>New scan rate units</h3>

<p>Scan rates defined in the menuScan.dbd file may now be specified in seconds,
minutes, hours or Hertz, and plural time units will also be accepted (seconds
are used if no unit is mentioned in the choice string). At <tt>iocInit</tt> each
scan rate is compared with the OS's clock tick and a warning printed if the
rate is too fast or likely to be more than 10% different to the requested rate.
For example the rates given below are all valid, although non-standard (the
default menuScan choices that come with Base have not been changed):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>menu(menuScan) {
    choice(menuScanPassive,     "Passive")
    choice(menuScanEvent,       "Event")
    choice(menuScanI_O_Intr,    "I/O Intr")
    choice(menuScan1_hour,      "1 hour")
    choice(menuScan0_5_hours, "0.5 hours")
    choice(menuScan15_minutes, "15 minutes")
    choice(menuScan5_minutes,   "5 minutes")
    choice(menuScan1_minute,    "1 minute")
    choice(menuScan10_seconds, "10 seconds")
    choice(menuScan5_seconds,   "5 seconds")
    choice(menuScan2_seconds,   "2 seconds")
    choice(menuScan1_second,    "1 second")
    choice(menuScan2_Hertz,     "2 Hertz")
    choice(menuScan5_Hertz,     "5 Hertz")
    choice(menuScan10_Hertz,   "10 Hz")
}</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Alarm filtering added to input record types</h3>

<p>The record types ai, calc, longin and mbbi have a new alarm filter added to
them. This provides a low-pass filter that can be used to delay the reporting of
alarms caused by the input level passing the HIGH, HIHI, LOW or LOLO values. The
filter is controlled with a new AFTC field that sets the filter's time constant.
The default value for this field is zero, which keeps the record's original
alarm behaviour.</p>

<p>The record must be scanned often enough for the filtering action to work
effectively and the alarm severity can only change when the record is processed,
but that processing does not have to be regular; the filter uses the time since
the record last processed in its calculation. Setting AFTC to a positive number
of seconds will delay the record going into or out of a minor alarm severity or
from minor to major severity until the input signal has been in that range for
that number of seconds.</p>

<h3>Post events on Waveform record's NORD field</h3>

<p>When the record type or device support modify the NORD field of a waveform
record, the record support code now posts DBE_VALUE and DBE_LOG events for that
field, signalling the array length change to any client monitoring the NORD
field.</p>

<h3>Attributes of Non-VAL Fields</h3>

<p>Non-VAL fields now report meaningful information for precision, units,
graphic limits, control limits, and alarm limits instead of simply using
PREC, EGU, HOPR, LOPR, DRVL, DRVH, HIHI, HIGH, LOW, and LOLO. All delay
fields have a default precision of 2 digits, units "s" and control limits
of 0 to 100,000 seconds (these precision and limit values can be changed
for each record type as a whole at runtime by updating a registered global
variable). Input fields like A-L of the calc record read their metadata
from the corresponding INPn link if possible.</p>
<h4>epicsStdioRedirect.h merged into epicsStdio.h</h4>

<p>The definitions from the header file epicsStdioRedirect.h have been moved
into epicsStdio.h so all calls to printf(), puts() and putchar() in files that
include that OSI header will now be subject to stdout redirection.  In past
releases (3.14.7 and later) it was necessary to request the redirection support
by including the epicsStdioRedirect.h header file.  The header file is still
provided, but now it just includes epicsStdio.h.</p>

<h4>Named Soft Events</h4>

<p>Soft events can now be given meaningful names instead of just using the
numbers 1-255. The EVNT field is now a DBF_STRING. The <tt>post_event()</tt> API
is now deprecated but still works. It should be replaced by code that in advance
looks up the <tt>EVNTPVT</tt> event handle associated with the named event by
calling <tt>eventNameToHandle(char *)</tt>, and when that event occurs passes
that handle to the new <tt>postEvent(EVNTPVT)</tt> routine (which may be called
from interrupt level). A new iocsh command <tt>postEvent <i>name</i></tt> will
trigger a named event from the command-line or a startup script (on vxWorks the
expression <tt>postEvent(eventNameToHandle("<i>name</i>"))</tt> must be used
instead though).</p>

<h4>Parallel Builds</h4>

<p>
As EPICS sites get computers with more CPUs they report additional bugs in our
parallel build rules. Various issues have been fixed by separating out the build
rules that generate dependency (.d) files, ensuring that they are constructed at
the appropriate time in the build.</p>

<p>
These rule changes can cause additional warning messages to appear when building
support modules. Where an application provides its own Makefile rules it may now
have to add rules to construct an associated dependency file. In many cases
though the change needed is just to replace a dependency for a
<tt>target$(OBJ)</tt> with the <tt>target$(DEP)</tt> so this</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(OBJ): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
becomes</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(DEP): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
To debug build issues assocated with dependency files, use the command <tt>make
--debug=m</tt> which tells GNUmake to display information about what it is doing
during the first pass when it updates its makefiles.</p>

<h3>
Removed tsDefs.h</h3>

<p>
The deprecated tsDefs API was provided for 3.13 compatibility only, and has now
been removed.  Convert any remaining code that used it to call the epicsTime API
instead.</p>

<h3>
Changes to epicsVersion.h</h3>

<p>
The two macros <tt>EPICS_UPDATE_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_CVS_SNAPSHOT</tt> have
been deleted from the epicsVersion.h file; they were deprecated in R3.14 and can
be replaced with <tt>EPICS_PATCH_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_DEV_SNAPSHOT</tt>
respectively.</p>

<p>
A new pair of macros has been added to make version number comparisons easier.
Code that will not work with a version of Base before 3.15.0 can now be
written like this to prevent it from compiling:</p>

<pre style="margin: 0 2em;">
#if defined(VERSION_INT) && EPICS_VERSION_INT < VERSION_INT(3,15,0,0)
#  error EPICS Base R3.15.0 or later is required
#endif
</pre>

<h3>
Added support for iocLogPrefix</h3>

<p>
Added a <code>iocLogPrefix</code> command to <code>iocsh</code>. This adds a
prefix to all messages from this IOC (or other log client) as they get sent to the
iocLogServer. This lets sites use the "fac=&lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;" syntax for
displaying the facility, process name etc. in log viewers like the
<code>cmlogviewer</code>.</p>

<h3>
Reworked the epicsEvent C &amp; C++ APIs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Renamed the enum epicsEventWaitStatus to epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitStatus as a macro for epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitOk to epicsEventOk</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitError to epicsEventError</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitOK and epicsEventWaitError as macros</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventTrigger(id) which triggers an event and returns OK or an
    error status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventMustTrigger(id) which halts on error</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventSignal(id) as a macro for epicsEventMustTrigger(id)</li>
  <li>Added a new C++ method epicsEvent::trigger() which throws an
    epicsEvent::invalidSemaphore in the event of an error</li>
  <li>epicsEvent::signal() makes an inline call to epicsEvent::trigger()</li>
  <li>epicsEventWait() and epicsEventWaitWithTimeout() now return an error
    status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>All the epicsEventMust...() routines are now implemented in the common
    libCom/osi/epicsEvent.cpp source file, and call cantProceed() instead of
    mis-using assert()</li>
  <li>Implemented epicsEventShow() on Posix</li>
  <li>Win32: Removed all epicsShareAPI decorations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Enabled histogram record type</h3>

<p>
The histogram record was not included in the base.dbd file in any 3.14 release,
but has now been added along with its associated soft device support. The build
system now generates the list of all the record.dbd files in base automatically
in src/std/rec/Makefile.</p>

<h3>
Reorganization of src/</h3>

<p>Reorganization of subdirectories of src/ to better represent the relation
between different parts as described in the following table.</p>

<p>This change also allows the number of libraries built to be reduced to:
libCap5.so,  libca.so,   libdbCore.so,    libdbStaticHost.so,
libCom.so,   libcas.so,  libdbRecStd.so, and  libgdd.so</p>
