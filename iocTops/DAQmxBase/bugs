============== ACTIVE BUGS  ==========================

#1 - minor
If you have an AO channel setup.
And then you set the frequency the things doesn't reset correctly and 
the data disappear somehow :(


#3 - minor
In Digital Input mode a DTIME interrupt will not be triggered.
Can easily fix by adding code. But It feels like it is a waste?


#4 - major
If the DAQmxBaseRead command does not return the required amount of samples.
And error does get print.
But for the rest nothing is altered and this can result in problems!


#5 - minor
There is sometimes a segfault when the IOC exits.
It seems that the thread dies somehow and then some stack frame gets lost or 
something.
As the IOC quits anyways this is not a serious problem :)
- I don't know how to find this now - Heinrich

#6 - major
If there is errors inside the IOC then this will not get through to alarms or 
something. So operators is unlikely to know something is going wrong.
This needs to be addressed ASAP - Heinrich
(just not sure how)

#7 - functional
With CO (counter output) mode.
If we set N=0 then we have continuous output and if we set N=1 we have 1 
pulse.
But setting up N=x doesn't work - only generates 1 pulse.
This seem to be a problem in DAQmxBase? Or either the NI 6014 card I 
have doesn't support this - Heinrich


#8 - minor
It seems as it the asynPrint output from  PortOptions doesn't happen?!

#9 - minor
The driver creates an excessive amount of interrupts.
Even if it reads a value that doesn't change it will still produce 
millions of interrupts.
Maybe we should implement if's to check if values actually changed? Or 
maybe even a hysteresis option? (Will only work if N=1 obviously)	

#10 - minor
around counters:
There are 3 types of CI counters.
And there are 4 types of ReadCounter commands.
I'm unsure what to use then. Currently there is options to force the 
issue. But the defaults should be setup to work in 99% of the cases :)

=============== RESOLVED ======================


#2
In non-monster mode:
It seems as if the Read returns the wrong data every so often?!?!
-
Fixed by stopping the task before starting again
