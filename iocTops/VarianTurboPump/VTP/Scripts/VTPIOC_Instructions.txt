VTP IOC OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

The Varian Turbo Pump (VTP) Input Output Controllers (IOCs) allow monitoring and control of multiple Agilent Turbo-V 2300 turbo-pumps, namely: TT01, TT02, TT03, and TT04.


Starting the IOCs
-----------------

On the desktop, double-click the "JET-VTPs" shortcut.

This will run any of the VTP IOCs that are not already running. (If none are running, runs them all).

Each IOC runs in its own Windows Command Prompt window.


Stopping the IOCs
-----------------

In the Windows Command Prompt window for an IOC, type "exit". This will gracefully stop the IOC.

You may now close the Command Prompt window.

Each IOC must be stopped individually.
