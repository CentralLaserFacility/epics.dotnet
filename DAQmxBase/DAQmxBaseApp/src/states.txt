This document describes the state machine.

MESSAGE: msgNoAction
Does nothing

MESSAGE: msgConfigure
Should configure/reconfigure
if unconfigured - state = configure
if idle - state = reconfigure
else if not configure - state = stop
(stopping the task will result in idle -> reconfigure)

MESSAGE: msgStart
if idle or start - state = start 
if unconfigured - state = configure
if running - state = stop -> result in reconfigure

MESSAGE: msgStop
state = stop

STATE: unconfigured
default startup state - waits

STATE: reconfigure
Clears task
recreate task
state= configure

STATE: configure
alloc buffers
Create channels
Setup timing 
Setup trigger
state = idle

STATE: idle
waits

STATE: start
if daqmode = Input : start task
interrupt ACQUIRE interface
depending on daqmode:
 state = acquireAnlg or acquireDig or acquireCnt or counterout or write

STATE: busywait
wait for event
unles noRestartTask: start task
state = acquireAnlg or acquireDig or acquireCnt

STATE: acquireAnlg
read analog
swap buffers & update pointers & run softtrigger
if !monstermode: stop task
if !polled: start task
interrupts
if polled: state = busywait

STATE: acquireDig
read digital
swap buffers & update pointers
if !monstermode: stop task
if !polled: start task
interrupts
if polled: state = busywait

STATE: acquireCnt
Read counter (4 different methods)
swap buffers & update pointers
if !polled & !monster & !noRestartTask: starttask
interrupts
if polled: state= busywait


STATE: write
wait for write event
stop task
write analog or digital
start task


STATE: counterout
wait for write event
start task

STATE: stop
stop task
interrupt ACQUIRE
state = idle


Should maybe create some diagram picture to represent this? -H
